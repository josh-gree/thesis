\section{Measurement Uncertainty}

Initially we will look at the average radius, taken over ten repetitions, at each level of magnification. In figure \ref{avgmeasuredradius} we can see the plot of this measurement for each of the four experimental treatments; ideal source and detector ($S0D0$), non-ideal source and ideal detector ($S1D0$), ideal source and non-ideal detector ($S0D1$) and non-ideal source and detector ($S1D1$). As can be seen from the plot all measurements are systematically biased below the true value of the imaged object (30mm). There exist clear trends in the behavior of the measurement as magnification increases for $S1D0$, $S0D1$, and $S1D1$. The ideal imaging system ($S0D0$) exhibits a less clear trend, seeming to be highly noisy.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/output_10_0.png}
    \caption{Showing the average radius at each magnification.}
    \label{avgmeasuredradius}
\end{figure}

We can also look at the relative error of the measurements since we are in the position of knowing the true value - this can be seen in figure \ref{relerrormeasuredradius}. The $S0D0$ treatment shows the lowest relative errors of all treatments, there appears to be an increase in the error as magnification increases however the data is rather noisy. Treatments $S1D0$ and $S0D1$ show opposing, possibly linear, trends. Measurements taken with a non-ideal detector seem to get more accurate as magnification increases whereas the measurements taken with a non-ideal source show a decrease in the accuracy with an increase in magnification. When the measurements are taken with both non-ideal source and detector the relative errors are the largest of all treatments. There appears to be a non-linear, perhaps quadratic, relation between magnification and measurement error.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/output_8_0.png}
    \caption{Showing the relative error of the radius measurement at each magnification.}
        \label{relerrormeasuredradius}
\end{figure}

It should be noted that all the measured errors are at the sub-voxel level; the largest error seen is around $0.4\%$ which equates to an actual deviation from the true value of around $0.12$mm less then $2\%$ of the voxel width ($4.2$mm).

In figure \ref{stdmeasuredradius} we can see the variation (standard deviation) in the measurement in relation to magnification. This data is only available for $S1D0$, $S0D1$ and $S1D1$. This is because with an ideal source and detector the measurement is in effect deterministic. The projections do have very small additive noise applied but this is not enough to effect the reconstructions and hence the measurements in any meaningful way.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/output_14_0.png}
    \caption{Showing the variation of the radius measurement at each magnification.}
        \label{stdmeasuredradius}
\end{figure}

Any trend in the measurement variation is less clear to see. However if we ignore the data point at a magnification of $1.5$ for $S0D1$ it could be the case that the variation is decreasing with magnification for a non-ideal detector and vice-versa for a non-ideal source. In order to test this hypothesis a further twenty reconstructions were conducted at magnifications of $1.5$, $2.0556$ and $4.0$; the increase in sample size at these points should give a clearer picture of the underlying measurement variation. It would have been of great interest to conduct more reconstructions at all magnifications but this would have taken far too long - the new samples where chosen to cover low, medium and high magnifications in the hope that any trend became clearer. Figure \ref{stdmeasuredradiusxsamples} shows the measurement variation for the higher sampled magnifications. This seems to show that as magnification increases the measurement variability increase for the $S1D0$ treatment and decreases for the the $S0D1$ treatment. In order to further reinforce this conclusion two one tail T-tests where performed to see if the differences in the measurement variation was statistically significant. In the first test, which compares the measurement variance between $S1D0$ and  $S0D1$ at a magnification of $1.5$, the null and alternative hypothesis's are given by;

\[
H_0: \sigma_{S1D0,1.5} = \sigma_{S0D1,1.5}
\]
\[
H_1: \sigma_{S1D0,1.5} < \sigma_{S0D1,1.5}
\]

The test resulted in a test statistic of $F=0.1781$ and p-value of $6.431e-06 < 0.01$ (m=29,n=29 degrees of freedom), so the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 95\% level suggesting that there is significant evidence that $\sigma_{S1D0,1.5} < \sigma_{S0D1,1.5}$. For the second test we will compare the measurement variance between $S1D0$ and  $S0D1$ at a magnification of $4.0$. The null and alternative hypothesis's are given by;

\[
H_0: \sigma_{S1D0,4.0} = \sigma_{S0D1,4.0}
\]
\[
H_1: \sigma_{S1D0,4.0} > \sigma_{S0D1,4.0}
\]

The test resulted in a test statistic $F = 0.1619$ and a p-value of $2.347e-06 < 0.01$ (m=29,n=29 degrees of freedom), so the null hypothesis can be rejected at the 95\% level suggesting that there is significant evidence that $\sigma_{S1D0,4.0} > \sigma_{S0D1,4.0}$.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/output_34_0.png}
    \caption{Showing the variation of the radius measurement with a sample of 30 at each magnification.}
        \label{stdmeasuredradiusxsamples}
\end{figure}

The result of the two F-tests reinforces the hypothesis that there exists contrasting trends in measurement uncertainty between $S0D1$ and $S1D0$. It seems clear that an increase in magnification leads to a decrease in measurement variability for $S0D1$ and an increase in the variability for $S1D0$ - with an intersection point (position of equal variability) at a magnification of between $2.5$ and $3.0$. The level of variability in the measurement also relates to the relative error in the measurement; high variability leads to a larger relative error. This can be clearly seen in the error and variability trends of the two treatments $S0D1$ and $S1D0$.

Further to the measurements of the radii, the position of the spheres centers were also calculated. Again all measurements resulted in a systematic bias; figure \ref{spherecentre} shows the average position for a range of magnifications.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/output_18_0.png}
    \caption{Showing the measured position of the spheres centre}
        \label{spherecentre}
\end{figure}

The average position of the centre does not exhibit any clear trend with respect to magnification. There does however seem to be differences between the individual treatments. Both $S0D0$ and $S0D1$ show little variation in the measured position as magnification varies, whereas $S1D1$ and $S1D0$ exhibit much greater fluctuations in the measured position. The standard deviation of the measured position, taken over ten repetitions at each magnification, is shown in figure \ref{spherecentrevar}. The logarithmic plot shows that the variation is an order of magnitude larger for $S1D0$ and $S1D1$ than for $S0D1$. This contrasts with the variation in the measured radius for which the standard deviation was approximately of the same magnitude for both $S1D0$ and $S0D1$.
