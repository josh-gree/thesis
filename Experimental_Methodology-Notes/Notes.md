# Experimental Methodolgy Notes

## Uncertainty, Precision and Accuracy

- Experiments have associated uncertainties, these limit our ability to draw conclusions

### Accuracy
- Accuracy is a quantification of a measurements "correctness", how well does it agree with the "true" value.
- We can calculate absolute deviation -> $x_m - x_t$, where $x_m$ is the measured value and $x_t$ is the "true" value.
- It is sometimes useful to express the deviation relative to the true value -> $\frac{x_m - x_t}{x_t}$
- It is only possible to talk about accuracy if we have some knowledge of the true value!

### Systematic Error
- Some deviation can be controlled for - if this is possible then we call these deviations systematic errors. These are values that can be corrected for.
- These can include errors associated with instrumentation, operator and procedure
- Systematic errors are usually uni-directional, when this is true the measurement is said to be biased.

### Indeterminate Error and Precision
- These are errors (deviations) that cannot usually be identified since they are random.
- These are often a result of the way nature behaves or are inherent in the set up of the experiment.
- precision is the quantification of how much repeated measurements agree - if there is little agreement between repeated measurements then the measurement is inaccurate. It is in some sense a measure of the 'goodness' of the measurement.
- knowledge of a measurements uncertainty allows for the comparison of similar measurement procedures - we can then say if two measurements undertaken by different procedures are 'identical' within the uncertainty of the procedures

### The mean of repeated measurements
- given a set of repeated measurements we can represent them by a single value - the mean. The question arises as to how certain we are that the mean represents the "best" guess of the true measurement?
- if there is lots of variation in the repeated measurement and we only have a small sample then this may give us an unrealistic understanding of what the true quintity actually is!

### Average deviation as a measure of precision
- we should use the std since it is in the same units as the measurement
- we could look at relative uncertainty -> $\sigma/x_t$
