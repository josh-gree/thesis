abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an easily-implemented technique with free publicly-available analysis software to measure the modulation transfer function (MTF) and noise-power spectrum (NPS) of a clinical computed tomography (CT) system from images acquired using a widely-available and standardized American College of Radiology (ACR) CT accreditation phantom.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Images of the ACR phantom were acquired on a Siemens SOMATOM Definition Flash system using a standard adult head protocol: 120 kVp, 300 mAs, and reconstructed voxel size of 0.49 mm × 0.49 mm × 4.67 mm. The radial (axial) MTF was measured using an edge method where the boundary of the third module of the ACR phantom, originally designed to measure uniformity and noise, was used as a circular edge. The 3D NPS was measured using images from this same module and using a previously-described methodology that quantifies noise magnitude and 3D noise correlation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The axial MTF was radially symmetrical and had a value of 0.1 at 0.62 mm(-1). The 3D NPS shape was consistent with the filter-ramp function of filtered-backprojection reconstruction algorithms and previously reported values. The radial NPS peak value was ∼115 HU(2)mm(3) at ∼0.25 mm(-1) and dropped to 0 HU(2)mm(3) by 0.8 mm(-1).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed an easily-implementable technique to measure the axial MTF and 3D NPS of clinical CT systems using an ACR phantom. The widespread availability of the phantom along with the free software the authors have provided will enable many different institutions to immediately measure MTF and NPS values for comparison of protocols and systems.},

abstract = {Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements are critical in many research studies investigating skeletal integrity. For pre-clinical research, micro-computed tomography ($\mu$CT) has become an essential tool in these studies. However, the ability to measure the BMD directly from $\mu$CT images can be biased by artifacts, such as beam hardening, in the image. This three-part study was designed to understand how the image acquisition process can affect the resulting BMD measurements and to verify that the BMD measurements are accurate. In the first part of this study, the effect of beam hardening-induced cupping artifacts on BMD measurements was examined. In the second part of this study, the number of bones in the X-ray path and the sampling process during scanning was examined. In the third part of this study, $\mu$CT-based BMD measurements were compared with ash weights to verify the accuracy of the measurements. The results indicate that beam hardening artifacts of up to 32.6\% can occur in sample sizes of interest in studies investigating mineralized tissue and affect mineral density measurements. Beam filtration can be used to minimize these artifacts. The results also indicate that, for murine femora, the scan setup can impact densitometry measurements for both cortical and trabecular bone and morphologic measurements of trabecular bone. Last, when a scan setup that minimized all of these artifacts was used, the $\mu$CT-based measurements correlated well with ash weight measurements (R2 = 0.983 when air was excluded), indicating that $\mu$CT can be an accurate tool for murine bone densitometry. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations. Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep, geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly. The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions, and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method, Steepest Descent, and Conjugate Gradients. Other topics include preconditioning and the nonlinear Conjugate Gradient Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is avoided. Concepts are explained in several differentways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},

In Part A of the present paper the problem which is solved is the inversion of this linear functional transformation, that is the following questions are answered: can every line function satisfying suitable regularity conditions be regarded as constructed in this way? If so, is f uniquely known from F and how can f be calculated? In Part B a solution of the dual problem of calculating a line function F(g) from its point mean values f(P) is solved in a certain sense. Finally, in Part C certain generalizations are discussed, prompted by consideration of non-Euclidean manifolds as well as higher dimensional spaces. The treatment of these problems, themselves of interest, gains enhanced importance through the numerous relationships that exist between this topic and the theory of logarithmic and Newtonian potentials. These are mentioned at appropriate places in the text.},

abstract = {The knowledge of measurement uncertainty is of great importance in conformance testing in production. The tolerance limit for production must be reduced by the amounts of measurement uncertainty to ensure that the parts are in fact within the tolerance. Over the last 5 years, industrial X-ray computed tomography (CT) has become an important technology for dimensional quality control. In this paper a computer simulation platform is presented which is able to investigate error sources in dimensional CT measurements. The typical workflow in industrial CT metrology is described and methods for estimating measurement uncertainties are briefly discussed. As we will show, the developed virtual CT (VCT) simulator can be adapted to various scanner systems, providing realistic CT data. Using the Monte Carlo method (MCM), measurement uncertainties for a given measuring task can be estimated, taking into account the main error sources for the measurement. This method has the potential to deal with all kinds of systematic and random errors that influence a dimensional CT measurement. A case study demonstrates the practical application of the VCT simulator using numerically generated CT data and statistical evaluation methods. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
