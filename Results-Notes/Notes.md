# Results Notes

this section should contain the main results of the project. How does magnification effect the measurements in the presence of source and detector offsets? Need to outline effects on the mean measurement as well as how the variance changes! All measurements show a systematic bias -> radius always smaller than truth, centre of sphere is always biased in one direction away from the truth. Need two sections really -> first results with only 10 reps for each param ( this was slightly noisy - can this be quantified?? - and it was decided to take more samples at low med and high mags in order to see the trends more clearly...) Second results with an extra 30 reps show trends more clearly.

What figures do I want?

-> Mean radii measurements (both small samples and larger...seperate? should I plot results where some mags have a larger sample size or should I only look at them seperately) -> All results with only 10 reps and then just low,med and high with 30 samples (Why did I not do extra samples in the D0S0 and D1S1 treatments?)

-> Mean centre coordinates

-> variance plots

-> fitted trend lines

-> normal plots for measurements

-> MTF variation, and some MTF plots

-> Line profiles comparison of polychromatic and mono

Reporting of T-test results shows that there is a significant difference in a particular direction for the variances between the treatments -> low magnification significant evidence that det offset has higher uncertainty than source offset, High magnification significant evidence that source offset has higher uncertainty than det offset. Fitted linear models have significant slope terms negative for det offset and positive for source offset -> should I look at the fits for the means as well or is this irrelevant?
